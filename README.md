# [Important: Work In Progress] Brand-Recognition in Keras

The goal of the project is to build a model that can recognise the brand in video advertisements. This brand could be one of the training data or any unknown brand. 

The dataset was collected manually for different advertisments in English and Urdu from different websites.

The approach that is believed to solve the problem involves building a model that will use an ConvLSTM (a type of Recurrent Neural Network) to create embeddings of each brand. The model will learn how to create embeddings from the video for each brand, an approach inspired from FaceNet. You can find more details in the file "Approach.pptx"
